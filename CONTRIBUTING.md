## Contributing to distr6

distr6 is currently being developed by a team of UCL collaborators within The Alan Turing Institute. Whilst we are not currently looking for external contributors, we welcome anyone to install the latest development version of distr6 and to experiment with the API. We welcome any issues being raised but will be mainly focused on internal pull requests. Before raising any issues please refer to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RaphaelS1/distr6/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Raising an Issue

Currently we will not be considering feature requests as the API is still experimental however we will welcome issues being raised. To do so please first [verify](https://github.com/RaphaelS1/distr6/issues) that your issue has not already been raised.
